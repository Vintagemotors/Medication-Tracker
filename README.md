### Medication Tracker

# WARNING: THIS IS CURRENTLY PRE-ALPHA SOFTWARE AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON, UNTIL STATED OTHERWISE THIS IS FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THIS MALFUNCTIONING! 

If you want a different interval than 12 hours or different options, download the html file, edit it, create your own respository and upload it. I do not want visible forks with 200 different settings configured. I am only hosting this because I do not want to set up an https localhost just for this.
