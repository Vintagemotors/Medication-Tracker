### FAQ
Q: Can you see my data?  
A: It uses local storage on your browser, I, or anyone else, without physical access to your browser should be able to access it. 

Q: Can I cloud sync this.  
A: I have no intention of cloud hosting medical data, if you want to do it yourself - go ahead. 

### Configuration
If you want a different interval than 12 hours or different options, download the html file, edit it, create your own respository and upload it. I do not want visible forks with 200 different settings configured. I am only hosting this because I do not want to set up an https localhost just for this. 
You need to edit every occurence of  12 * 60 * 60 * 1000 (12 is hours).
